## Reference ladder
0. Specification/property/math
1. Known-good input/output
2. Known-good component
3. Trusted implementation
4. Trusted end-to-end system

Use the lowest sufficient level. Compare intermediate states, not only final output.

Normalize inputs, configuration, precision, ordering, seeds, versions, and tolerances before declaring a mismatch.
